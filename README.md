# patchlogue
[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/anthonyray/patchlogue/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/anthonyray/patchlogue/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

[A tool](https://www.patchlogue.com) to help you visualize patches created on your [KORG Prologue synthesizer](https://www.korg.com/products/synthesizers/prologue/).

Just plug your KORG Prologue in, select the appropriate MIDI INs and OUTs, and start visualizing your patches !

In one glance, you can inspect and get a sense of the parameters used to make up the sound of your patches. You can also save your patches so that you can visualize them later.
